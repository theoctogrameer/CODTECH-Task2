This C program uses macros to convert temperatures between Celsius, Kelvin, and Fahrenheit. It defines macros for each conversion formula, such as converting Celsius to Kelvin, Celsius to Fahrenheit, and so on. In the `main` function, the program initializes variables for each temperature scale (Celsius, Kelvin, and Fahrenheit) and uses the defined macros to perform conversions. The results of converting 150°C to Kelvin and Fahrenheit, 150K to Celsius and Fahrenheit, and 150°F to Celsius and Kelvin are then printed. The use of macros simplifies the temperature conversion process and makes the code more readable.
